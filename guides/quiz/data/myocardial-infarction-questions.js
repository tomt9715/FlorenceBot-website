The infusion must be stopped IMMEDIATELY. This is a medical emergency requiring emergent CT scan and neurosurgical consultation.",

These populations often present WITHOUT classic chest pain \u2014 instead showing fatigue, nausea, and epigastric discomfort. The ST depression suggests ischemia (possible NSTEMI). Troponin takes 2-4 hours to rise, so a normal initial level at 4 hours does not rule out MI. Serial troponins at 3-6 hour intervals are essential to detect the characteristic rise-and-fall pattern.",
                a: "Discharging this patient is dangerous. Her demographics (elderly, diabetic, female) place her at high risk for \"silent MI\" with atypical presentation. One normal troponin does not rule out MI.",
